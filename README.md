# dahlia - BDD unit testing for Dart
dahlia is a behavior-driven-development unit testing framework for the programming language Dart. It is highly inspired by Jasmine and RSpec.

## Install ##

To use dahlia, add it as a dependency in the pubspec.yml for your application:

    dependencies:
      dahlia:
        git: git://github.com/it-agile/dahlia.git

Then install the package:

    pub install

## Example
```dart
import 'package:dahlia/dahlia.dart';

main() {
  describe('two equal strings', () {
    it('should be equal', () => expect('test').to(equal('test')));
  });
  new Runner([new ConsoleReporter()]).run();  
}
```
This will produce the following output

```
 All tests
  two equal strings
   should be equal

specs: 1, failures: 0, crashes: 0
```

For futher information take a look at the tests in the tests-directory. They show what is currently possible with dahlia and are continuously expanded as new features are added.
